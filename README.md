# Inspiration
We were inspired by home security and monitoring devices to create a device that helps reduce your environmental footprint and improve your health

# What it does
The TomBot monitors the state of your room and notifies you through Discord when certain conditions are met. The user will be notified if: the lights have been left on for too long, if movement is detected within the room when the user is not present and if the temperature is too high or low.

# How we built it
We built it using an Arduino UNO R3 equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, and light sensor. The housing was designed in Fusion 360 and printed on Bambu Labs 3D printers. The Arduino was programmed in C++ in the Arduino IDE and the Discord bot was coded in Python in Visual Studio Code.

# Challenges we ran into
We were given a time limit to create the project and had limited resources. After 3D modeling the housing for the components, we realized that there was not enough time to print it before the deadline. Many adjustments to the housing were made to compensate. We also had to learn how to code with Arduino, allowing us to integrate Arduino with python.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was our first time participating in a hackathon and we are proud of our creation as beginners given the time we had and limited amount of resources and knowledge.

# What we learned
We learned how to wire and program Arduino kit to help with useful tasks in our daily life.

# What's next for TomBot
TomBot has a long way to go, from design improvements to feature implementation, there is much more this bot can do to improve our lives.
